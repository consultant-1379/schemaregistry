TEST FW ACCESS ON THE KAAS
==========================

The TestFw creates a Test Pod which performs Helm and Kubectl commands.
Roles and RoleBindings need to be created to allow the test pod to perform these commands.

See manifests in this directory.

For Kubectl permissions: 

-  testfw_role_k8s.yaml 
-  testfw_bind_k8s.yaml

For Helm permissions:

-  testfw_role.yaml
-  testfw_bind.yaml
